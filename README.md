# Hypothesis-testing-in-Chinook-database
I used the chinook database and ran A/B testing on how the duration of a song in a music library results in business metric for all tracks, a particular album, a particular artist, a particular genre and a particular playlist. The results were recorded as a form of number of orders due to low/high duration of the song.
